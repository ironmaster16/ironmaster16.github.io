# Iceland Curated - Strategy & Goals

## Summary

## The Core Strategy

**Position:** "Reliable link directory maintained by someone in Iceland"

**NOT:** Local expert with hidden gems

**IS:** Human who verifies links work, filters garbage, includes official sources

**Value:** In a world of AI spam, a clean directory with working links is actually valuable

## What This Requires

- Monthly link verification (1-2 hours/month)
- Keep it simple, fast, no BS
- Be transparent about what you are/aren't

## Traffic Reality

Slow growth via word-of-mouth:

Worth it **IF** you can commit to maintenance

## Critical Success Factor

**Trust dies with broken links.** Only do this if you'll maintain it for 2+ years.
